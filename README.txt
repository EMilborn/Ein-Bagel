DESCRIPTION
jPaint is a tool to paint in the terminal. You control a cursor and can utilize many tools to paint anything you want (with the constraint of a 32x32 palette). For a demonstration of what is possible with this program, press L to load the file "mario" in the first screen of the program.

HOW TO USE
To run the program, open an ANSI terminal with 256 colors(basically not Windows Command Prompt), change directory to Ein-Bagel, and execute:
$ bash jPaint.sh
