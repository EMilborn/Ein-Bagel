      Decide where to center brush

       Figure out a good format to save in, CSV?
       	      chose space separation
       Make algo to read data from file directly into the array
       Make alternate option at beginning of program to load
       Make saving dialog, with name of file
       
[DONE]Fill tool
     Recursive algo: change this color, find all neighbors around with same base color, repeat on them, global? var to keep track of checked tiles
     Optimize if necessary
     
[DONE]Shape tools
      Rect tool: Make it like the screen size chooser
      Circle tool: Might be harder, but find all tiles within a certain euclidean dist from center, use fill-like algo?
      Poly tool: Might not even be worth it, wouldn't convey well over such a pixelated medium
      
Fix issue with blinking when moving too fast
    Research way to print all at once/not display output until finished processing
